Wanted to use objects and classes more to get used to them as I wanted to round out my skills more. Styling was trickier here than in my  previous vanilla js projects as there were more elements to consider, such as positioning of the question and answers. Ergonomic positioning of buttons and rounding off of borders of buttons to fit a form, box shadows and more. These helped me give some much needed attention to my styling skills, however much they still lack.
